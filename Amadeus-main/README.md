# Nyarch Assistant tutorial
In this section you can find a quick tutorial on how to configure Nyarch Assistant to achieve similar results to those in the video.

#### 1. Install Nyarch Assistant
Nyarch Assistant can be installed on **any linux distribution using Flatpak**.
Plese note that alternative packaging formats are not supported yet, so just use flatpak.
Once you have your linux distro setup, installation is pretty easy:
1. Install flatpak and flathub, following [this for your distribution](https://flathub.org/setup)
2. Install Nyarch Assistant, following [this section of Nyarch Assistant readme](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/NyarchAssistant?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

#### 2. Start Nyarch Assistant
Using your application launcher start Nyarch Assistant. In case you don't have one, you can start it using the command `flatpak run moe.nyarchlinux.assistant`.

This is what it should look like on startup:

<img width="1670" height="949" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-19 15-52-40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cb7faf1-d2e6-448b-bbaa-e6098a994bc8" />

#### 3. Create a new profile
I suggest you to start creating a new profile. Profiles have their own settings, in that way you can always go back to defaults. You can use this feature also to have multiple version of this configuration for multiple use cases. (You have plenty of options so you probably will)

<img width="1430" height="827" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-19 16-01-50" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42eb4e3a-d897-478d-bd32-554d7fa6e4d4" />


<img width="1430" height="827" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-19 16-03-31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a19cb311-3afa-48fb-84e2-4ed987df59cb" />

As you can see, she is really happy for her profile name.

#### 4. Choose an LLM
You can choose to use basically any LLM. Any OpenAI compatible model is supported, in addition to Ollama, Gemini, Claude and others. Also, if you want you can set a custom command to run the LLM or make your own extension to add it.

In the demo, `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free` from OpenRouter is used. It is available for free for 50 req/day on OpenRouter, but you can use **whathever model you prefer**, Nyarch Assistant has a lot of providers to choose from, **including local ones**.

To make an informed choice about what model to pick, read the [LLM](#llm) section.

<img width="1440" height="822" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-19 16-04-26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab293b8d-8202-49af-a35e-e68db5705feb" />

#### 5. Choose an Avatar
For the avatar, there are three options supported and showed in the demo:
##### 1. Live2D Avatar

**New Live2D avatar**: [here](https://nyarchlinux.moe/Kurisu.zip)
You can download the Live2D avatar [here](https://nyarchlinux.moe/kurisu.tar.gz) and uncompress it.

After that, go in the settings, go in the Avatar section and scroll down. Expand the Live2D option and click on the folder icon next to the model list:

<img width="762" height="698" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-21 14-38-51" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31a5869e-00c1-4fb2-9aea-ee833ef0a5ef" />

Drop the model folder in the opened folder.
<img width="954" height="632" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-21 14-39-05" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3d4bc41-2dc2-4b13-a9ca-a62e71c6c4f4" />

After that refresh the list of models and pick the Amadeus model:

<img width="762" height="698" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-21 14-39-15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7011356-dd22-4e02-8f21-8032f16c6d91" />

<img width="661" height="595" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-21 14-40-33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e185e63-628a-4c33-884a-e1ecec790701" />

And here you go. (You can drag the model with the mouse).

<img width="1522" height="922" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-21 14-41-43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66fff0e5-811b-4371-ac15-cb1030c44345" />

##### 2. LivePNG Avatar
LivePNG is the visual novel style. 

Go in the settings, go in the Avatar section and scroll down. Click on the download button

<img width="762" height="698" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-23 14-48-42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80802877-ea6f-43a0-9c79-ad3d54723c41" />

And it will download automatically Kurisu model.
After that, select the model from the settings.

##### 3. Live2D Desktop Pet
This does only work on Gnome wayland and Hyprland at the moment. For installation refer to [this](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/DesktopPuppet).

#### 6. TTS Configuration
For more information about TTS choice read the TTS section.
In the demo, the TTS used is locally run GPTSoVITS with one-shot voice cloning.
For this, you have to install the [Newelle Voice Cloning extension](https://github.com/FrancescoCaracciolo/Newelle-Voice-Cloning).
1. Downlaod the [cloning.py](https://github.com/FrancescoCaracciolo/Newelle-Voice-Cloning/blob/main/cloning.py) file in the repo
2. Open the extensions menu in Nyarch Assistant
<img width="1458" height="840" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-21 14-42-16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa5c2431-819e-4d4f-89b7-a8e393d75e9f" />

3. Click on Install extension from file
5. Select the cloning.py file
<img width="1012" height="672" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dda1c0f-81d5-4038-9944-0cd6dc14c7a1" />

After that the extension will be enabled

<img width="622" height="622" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33e0d499-f514-4c68-a4d3-e46123984a32" />


5. Open the settings, go to Avatar and then expand the Text To Speech section and scroll down to SoVITS 2, click on the install button next to it and select it.

<img width="762" height="698" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e020e7c-31ee-4940-a7be-cf4dc7214597" />
Now, we need to configure it.

#### 7. Prompting 

First of all, disable Smart Prompts. They dinamically add some information about Nyarch Linux in the prompt, but for our puprposes it can make outputs worst.

<img width="762" height="698" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4118f1c-2bfd-4b47-a493-983eb52367cc" />

I also suggest you to keep off or edit the "helpful assistant" prompt. Kurisu is not very helpful and she doesn't like being called assistant.

Now, let's edit the personality prompt with the prompt you prefer from the **Prompts folder**. In the demo, **"Kurisu_EN.txt"** is used.

I strongly suggest you to have **prompt and expected LLM output in the same language**. You can ask another LLM to translate your prompts into your preferred langauge.

<img width="762" height="698" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56d2dcdf-1baa-451c-878c-d8ff44ec1185" />

You can also choose to translate or edit the other prompts based on your preferences.
I also suggest you to add this prompt in the "Custom Prompt" section:
```
{COND:
[tts_on] Give concise answers, what you say will be spoken out loud
}
```
In this way, when TTS is enabled, the LLM will give short answers.

You can find more about prompting in the [Newelle Wiki](https://github.com/qwersyk/Newelle/wiki/Prompt-variables).

If you want, you can also specify the scenario and give your username putting the {USER} variable in the prompt. (You can set the username in the General settings).

#### 8. Adding Kurisu's Knowledge
In order to give the LLM the memory of Kurisu, we only extract relevant parts from the Steins;Gate Visual Novel script, and put them in the prompt.

First of all, download the dialogue script [here](https://github.com/FrancescoCaracciolo/Amadeus/blob/main/Dialogues/SG_Dialogues_EN.md).

1. Go in the settings, enable knowledge->document folder.
2. Open your documents directory

<img width="762" height="698" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81c0bc1b-d1c4-4901-8821-922a1b5fd06d" />

3. Drop SG_Dialogues_EN.md in that folder
<img width="1150" height="604" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8209473-ac54-4fed-a68f-932d2c97f679" />

You can also drop there any other file you want as knowledge. If you want, you can also add [SG_Story_EN.md](), in order to give some synthetized knowledge.

I also suggest you to put many limited-length chunks.

Then index your documents (might take some seconds):

<img width="762" height="698" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fac6bd6a-6a0a-4f8b-b1b5-67f3c0d57185" />

When it's done, close the settings. Now some lines from the VN will be added to the prompt, for example:
<img width="1532" height="781" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2d2b50b-ccdb-4859-bd26-2d4baa1d6b1a" />

#### 9. Speech To Text
For speech to text you can choose anything, it doesn't really change Kurisu's personality.
I suggest to use locally run Whisper.CPP, and also add something like "The user is talking to Kurisu Makise" to the prompt in order to pick the right words. In the demo BASE (EN) Model has been used.

##### Endpoint
First of all, the endpoint. It is where the TTS model is run. By default it runs on [this huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/XXXXRT/GPT-SoVITS-ProPlus), but it is very slow. I suggest to run it locally if you have a Nvidia GPU.
In order to host the space locally you can install docker on your system (Instructions for Arch, check installtion on your specific distro):
```bash
sudo pacman -S docker nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```
And then run the container:
```bash
sudo docker run -it -p 7860:7860 --platform=linux/amd64 --gpus all \
	registry.hf.space/francescocaracciolo-gpt-sovitsproplus:latest python inference_webui.py
```
If running locally, put in the endpoint: `http://localhost:7860`

#### TTS
For TTS you can use this model made to mimic Kurisu's voice (not voice cloning): https://huggingface.co/Loke-60000/christina-TTS
##### Reference voice
Reference voice is the voice to clone. 
I suggest you to use the audio in the same language of the output.
You can find some audio files for one shot voice cloning the the [Voices/OneShot directory](https://github.com/FrancescoCaracciolo/Amadeus/tree/main/Voices/OneShot).

After downloading the files, click on the icon folder next to the "Reference Audio" row, drop the files there, click the refresh button and select the audio you want.

Then put the "reference prompt" text (transcription of the reference audio, you can find it in a txt file named like the audio file).
Then select the input and output languages.

The final configuration should look something like this:

<img width="762" height="698" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-23 15-19-54" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9f4728e-5660-432c-a090-52d62f718887" />

If you want the output of the LLM to be in a different language from the LLM, enable the translator:
<img width="762" height="698" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-23 15-33-10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e0e4a7d-baa1-4bc4-b0bd-d93f80c59554" />



# General Configuration
### LLM
#### Models
In order to make an LLM to behave like Kurisu, there are two possible apporaches:
1. Training/Fine Tuning a model specifically to be able to behave like Kurisu
2. Using a general purpose model and specify its behavior via prompting (and some more advanced techniques explained in [Memory and Knowledge](#memory-and-knowledge))

While training usually gives the best results, it has a lot of cost/efficiency downsides:
- At the moment of writing (and I doubt in the future), there is no provider offering Amadeus models, meaning that **they must be run locally** or on **providers** that offer running custom models (that are generally much more **expensive**)
- Training is expensive, so generally **models** trained for this **are small**, resulting in **worse performance compared to big models with good prompts**
- LLMs still advance pretty quickly, so trained models might get outdated after a couple of months.

There is already a model trained on Kurisu based on Llama 3.1 that is a preview, you can download it from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/amadeusproject/amadeus-8b-base-preview).

For general purpose models, here are my suggestions:
- For small models that are runnable locally: `qwen3` and `gemma3` models (and those based on them) are pretty good, choose the size based on your VRAM / RAM.
- For big open weights models, I suggest `deepseek-v3-0528`, `kimi-k2` and `qwen3` models.
- For closed models, `gemini` models are pretty cheap, `mistral` models are worth a try, `grok4` and `gpt-4o` are pretty good but expensive

For reference benchmark, I suggest [this](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DontPlanToEnd/UGI-Leaderboard).

#### Providers
If you want to run models locally, use Ollama. If you don't want to run them locally, there are many free APIs:
- OpenRouter
- Groq
- Gemini

You can find a good list [here](https://github.com/cheahjs/free-llm-api-resources).

If you are willing to pay, I also suggest to use Openrouter.

### TTS
For TTS, you can choose to use a generic TTS, or a TTS obtained using voice cloning of Kurisu's voice actor.

In case you choose to use a generic TTS, it is suggested to use "Kokoro TTS" (locally run, open source and very fast even on CPU and well supported on Nyarch Assistant with amazing sound quality), or Edge TTS (closed, online only but fast and good quality).

Other options are using [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) (one of the highest quality TTS, closed and payment only), and [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) (nice quality, closed, but with 200$ free credit on registration, use it with this [extension](https://github.com/FrancescoCaracciolo/NewelleExtensions/blob/main/extensions/deepgram.py)).

#### Voice Cloning 
**Please, don't use voice cloning for bad things**

For voice cloning there are three possible approaches:
1. Fine-tune a voice cloning model 
2. Use a one-shot voice cloning model (clone from just 10s of audio)
3. Use a generic TTS + RVC voice conversion to make it sound like Kurisu 

##### One Shot voice cloning 
There are multiple models that support one shot voice cloning in Newelle in this [repository](https://github.com/FrancescoCaracciolo/Newelle-Voice-Cloning).
In the demonstration, GPT-SoVITS is used.


##### Fine Tuning 
There is still no tutorial or model made for this. You can find a dataset for training in Japanese in the Voices folder.

##### TTS + Voice Conversion
You can find Kurisu Makise's model I have trained on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/FrancescoCaracciolo/Kurisu-RVC).
I have not written an extension to do this yet, but I plan it in the future.


### Prompting
In the Prompts folder you can find some prompts we have made for Kurisu and Amadeus personalities. You are invited to help us to improve that existing prompts and add new prompts.

### Memory and Knowledge
In this section we will divide the memory in three categories:
1. Memory of interaction with the user 
2. Memory of Kurisu Makise dialogues
3. Knowledge about S;G and everything else

#### User Interactions
For long term memory on user interactions there are many techniques, at the moment in Nyarch Assistant there are two:
1. User summary: just ask an LLM to make a summary about the conversation every X messages, and put it in the prompt
2. Memoripy: saves old messages in a vector database, categorizes them and retrieves the more relevant messages. This is more similar to human memory as it also has memory decay of memories that are not called ofter, and memory boost for memories more asked

But there are many other approaches.

#### Kurisu Dialogues
THe idea is simple: put the dialogues in a vector database, and pick the most semantically similar dialogues with the user query and put them in the prompt.
This has two advantages:
1. Give the LLM a good idea of Kurisu speaking style and ideas (like few-shot prompting)
2. If similar conversations are found, the answer will also be similar

#### Knowledge about S;G
Having some parts of dialogues is not enough to have the big picture. A proper summary of the series gives a better idea of the story to the LLM.

Of course, not the full summary is given, but only the relevant parts (using semantic search).


### Avatar 
For avatar, Nyarch Assitant supports natively:
- Live2D (usually used by VTubers)
- LivePNG (Format made specifically for Newelle, VN Style)
Both support expressions.

You can download the Live2D model [here](https://nyarchlinux.moe/kurisu.tar.gz). It doesn't have motions or expressions, but they are supported by Nyarch Assistant.
Also, I don't know the author of this model, if you know it open an issue.

For LivePNG, you can find it [here](https://github.com/FrancescoCaracciolo/LivePNG).

### Additional tools 
Nyarch Assistant has support for many tools, form code execution to web search. Also, Newelle extensions are fully supported.

In addition to that here are some extensions to introduce some tools specifically for Amadeus:

#### Divergence Meter
The divergence meter allows the AI to check the divergence value from [https://divergence.nyarchlinux.moe](https://divergence.nyarchlinux.moe), that tries to estimate the divergence of the current worldline using world news. 

<img width="1510" height="967" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-24 15-05-37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22241eaa-3737-4dec-9ed2-30d2d0695ce7" />


#### Image Generation
Generate Kurisu's images at every message using a custom Lora. You can use the Newelle image generation extension and load a custom Lora.

<img width="1510" height="967" alt="Screenshot From 2025-07-24 15-29-26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb543cc9-f81a-4e8a-8b35-2f8f2a209c86" />


For example, in the screenshot, [this setup](https://civitai.com/images/643458) is used, with this prompt:

- To generate images use: 
```generateimage
prompt
```
Use detailed prompts, with english words separated by commas.

At every message, generate an image of yourself in the pose you take during the conversation. 
Describe only the environment and your pose, without describing your appearence.

#### Calendar
Manage your calendar with Kurisu.
